| 1        | Refactored app into multiple files (`HomeScreen.tsx`, `ManageMenuScreen.tsx`, `FilterScreen.tsx`).  |
| 2        | Moved **add menu item** feature from home to a separate **Manage Menu Screen**.                     |
| 3        | Added **remove menu item** functionality for chefs.                                                 |
| 4        | Added **average price by course** display on the home screen.                                       |
| 5        | Created a **Filter Screen** allowing guests to view items by course (Starter, Main, Dessert, etc.). |
| 6        | Implemented use of **loops (`for`, `forEach`, `for-in`)** for calculations and filtering.           |
| 7        | Introduced **functions** for modular and clean code (e.g., `averagePriceByCourse`).                 |
| 8        | Improved structure and readability (refactoring, TypeScript type definitions).                      |
| 9        | Added navigation using React Navigation for multi-screen app flow.                                  |
| 10       | Updated styling and layout consistency.                                                             |
